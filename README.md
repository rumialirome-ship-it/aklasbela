# Aklasbela.tv - Production Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy the Aklasbela.tv full-stack application on a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 server.

We will use:
-   **Vite** to build the frontend into optimized static assets.
-   **SQLite** as the SQL database engine.
-   **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to serve the frontend and route API requests.
-   **PM2** as a process manager to keep the Node.js backend running continuously.
-   **Certbot (Let's Encrypt)** to secure the application with a free SSL certificate (HTTPS).

---

### **Prerequisites**

1.  **Ubuntu 22.04 Server**: A clean installation of Ubuntu 22.04.
2.  **Domain Name**: A domain (`aklasbela-tv.com`) with its DNS 'A' record pointing to your server's public IP address.
3.  **SSH Access**: You must be able to connect to your server via SSH.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Server Setup**

First, connect to your server via SSH and perform these initial configuration steps.

1.  **Update System Packages**:
    Ensure your server's package list and installed packages are up-to-date.
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

2.  **Configure Firewall (UFW)**:
    We'll set up a basic firewall to allow only essential traffic (SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS).
    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
    sudo ufw enable
    ```
    When prompted, type `y` and press Enter to proceed.

3.  **Install Node.js with NVM**:
    Using Node Version Manager (nvm) is recommended as it allows you to manage multiple Node.js versions easily.
    ```bash
    # Download and run the nvm installation script
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

    # Source your shell configuration to start using nvm
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"

    # Install Node.js version 18 (LTS) and set it as the default
    nvm install 18
    nvm use 18
    nvm alias default 18
    ```
    Verify the installation: `node -v` should show a version like `v18.x.x`.

---

### **Step 2: Upload Application Files**

Next, we'll create the necessary directory and upload your application code from your local machine to the server.

1.  **Create Project Directory on the Server**:
    We will host the entire application in `/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv`.
    ```bash
    # Create the main project directory
    sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv

    # Set the current user as the owner of this directory
    # This allows you to upload files without needing sudo.
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv
    ```

2.  **Upload Files from Local Machine**:
    Open a **new terminal on your local computer**. Use `scp` (secure copy) to transfer all your project files and folders (including the `backend` directory) into the server directory.

    ```bash
    # Replace /path/to/your/local/project/* with the actual path on your computer.
    # The '*' ensures the contents of the directory are copied.
    # Replace your_server_ip with your server's IP address.
    scp -r /path/to/your/local/project/* your_username@your_server_ip:/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/
    ```
    After this step, your server's `/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/` directory should contain your `index.html`, `package.json`, the `backend/` folder, and all other project files.

---

### **Step 3: Frontend Setup & Build**

Before setting up the backend, we need to install the frontend dependencies and create a production-ready build.

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
    This command reads the root `package.json` file and installs libraries like React and Vite.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Frontend**:
    This script compiles the React/TypeScript application into static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files inside a `dist` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    After this step, you will have a new `/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/dist` folder containing the optimized frontend assets.

---

### **Step 4: Backend Setup with PM2**

Now, let's configure and launch the Node.js backend application.

1.  **Navigate to the Backend Directory on the Server**:
    ```bash
    cd /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/backend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    This reads `package.json` and installs the required libraries (Express, JWT, etc.).
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  **Install SQLite and Setup Database**:
    The application uses SQLite for its database.
    ```bash
    # Install the SQLite command-line tool
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install sqlite3 -y

    # Run the database setup script
    # This reads the initial data from db.json, creates a database.sqlite file,
    # and populates it with the necessary tables and data.
    npm run db:setup
    ```
    > **Note**: This setup script is designed to run only once. If you need to reset the database, you must first delete the `backend/database.sqlite` file. You can now safely remove `backend/db.json`.


4.  **Create Environment File (`.env`)**:
    This file stores your application's secrets.
    ```bash
    nano .env
    ```
    Add the following content. **It is critical to generate a strong, unique secret for `JWT_SECRET`**. You can use an online generator or a command like `openssl rand -base64 32`.
    ```
    PORT=3005
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_and_long_jwt_key_here
    API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    > **Note**: The `API_KEY` is for the Google Gemini API. You can get a key from Google AI Studio. This is required for the "AI Lucky Pick" feature.
    
    Save and close the file (`Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

5.  **Install PM2 Globally**:
    PM2 is the process manager that will keep your backend running.
    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    ```

6.  **Start the Backend with PM2**:
    This command starts the server, names the process `aklasbella`, and will restart it automatically if it crashes.
    ```bash
    pm2 start server.js --name aklasbella
    ```

7.  **Configure PM2 to Start on Boot**:
    This ensures that if your server reboots, your application will automatically restart.
    ```bash
    pm2 startup
    ```
    Run the command that PM2 gives you (it will start with `sudo env...`).

8.  **Save the Process List**:
    ```bash
    pm2 save
    ```
    You can check the status of your backend anytime with `pm2 status`.

---

### **Step 5: Nginx Configuration (Reverse Proxy)**

Nginx will act as the web server. It will serve your built frontend files and forward API requests (`/api/...`) to your backend.

1.  **Install Nginx**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install nginx -y
    ```

2.  **Create an Nginx Configuration File**:
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/aklasbela-tv.com
    ```

3.  **Add the following configuration**:
    This file tells Nginx how to handle requests for `aklasbela-tv.com`.
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name aklasbela-tv.com www.aklasbela-tv.com;

        # CRITICAL: Path to your project's *BUILD* folder.
        root /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/dist;
        index index.html;

        # For single-page applications, this ensures that refreshing any page
        # still serves the main index.html file.
        location / {
            try_files $uri /index.html;
        }

        # Proxy API requests to the backend Node.js server running on port 3005
        location /api/ {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:3005;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    }
    ```
    > ## 🔴 CRITICAL: The `root` Path is EVERYTHING! 🔴
    >
    > The most common deployment failure is setting this path incorrectly. It **MUST** point to the `/dist` subfolder.
    >
    > **Correct Structure:**
    > ```
    > /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/   <-- DO NOT point here
    > └── dist/                    <-- DO point here
    >     └── index.html           <-- The real app
    > ```
    >
    > If you point it to the project root, your site will show a **"CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT MISCONFIGURATION"** error page and will not load. Double-check this line before saving.

    Save and close the file.

4.  **Enable the Site**:
    This creates a link from the `sites-available` directory to the `sites-enabled` directory, which Nginx reads from.
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/aklasbela-tv.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```

5.  **Test and Restart Nginx**:
    ```bash
    sudo nginx -t  # Test for syntax errors
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
    If the test is successful, your site should now be accessible at `http://aklasbela-tv.com`.

---

### **Step 6: Secure Your Site with HTTPS (Let's Encrypt SSL)**

Finally, we will secure your site with a free SSL certificate.

1.  **Install Certbot**:
    Certbot is the tool that automates obtaining and renewing SSL certificates.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
    ```

2.  **Obtain and Install the SSL Certificate**:
    This command will automatically detect your domain from the Nginx configuration, get a certificate, and update your Nginx file to use HTTPS.
    ```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx -d aklasbela-tv.com -d www.aklasbela-tv.com
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts:
    -   Enter your email address (for renewal notices).
    -   Agree to the terms of service.
    -   Choose whether to share your email.
    -   When asked about redirecting HTTP traffic, choose option `2` to redirect. This is highly recommended for security.

3.  **Verify Automatic Renewal**:
    Certbot sets up a scheduled task to renew your certificate automatically. You can test it with a dry run.
    ```bash
    sudo certbot renew --dry-run
    ```
    If there are no errors, you're all set.

### **Deployment Complete!**

Your Aklasbela.tv platform is now live and secure. You can access it at **`https://aklasbela-tv.com`**.

---

### **Updating the Application**

When you have new code changes to deploy, follow these steps to ensure they are applied correctly.

1.  **Upload New Files**:
    Use `scp` or another method to transfer your updated files to the server, overwriting the old ones. For example, to update the backend:
    ```bash
    # On your local machine
    scp -r /path/to/your/local/project/backend/* your_username@your_server_ip:/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/backend/
    ```

2.  **Rebuild Frontend (if necessary)**:
    If you made changes to the frontend code (any file outside the `backend` directory), you must create a new build.
    ```bash
    # On the server
    cd /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv
    npm run build
    ```

3.  **Restart the Backend Process**:
    Simply running `pm2 restart` can sometimes fail to pick up all changes. A more reliable method is to use `reload`.
    ```bash
    # On the server
    pm2 reload aklasbella
    ```

4.  **Check the Logs**:
    After restarting, immediately check the logs to confirm the new version is running and there are no errors.
    ```bash
    pm2 logs aklasbella
    ```

---

### **Managing Your Application**

-   **View backend logs**: `pm2 logs aklasbella`
-   **Restart the backend**: `pm2 restart aklasbella`
-   **Stop the backend**: `pm2 stop aklasbella`
-   **Check Nginx status**: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
-   **Restart Nginx**: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

### **Troubleshooting**

-   **Admin Login Fails AND/OR No Games Show on Landing Page**:
    -   **Cause**: This is the most common issue after the initial deployment. It almost always means the backend database (`database.sqlite`) was not created or populated correctly. The backend server might have started before the setup script was run, creating an empty database file which the setup script then refuses to overwrite.
    -   **Solution**: You must force a recreation of the database. Follow these steps precisely on your server:
        1.  **Stop the backend server**:
            ```bash
            pm2 stop aklasbella
            ```
        2.  **Navigate to the backend directory**:
            ```bash
            cd /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/backend
            ```
        3.  **Delete the incorrect database file**:
            ```bash
            rm database.sqlite
            ```
        4.  **Run the setup script again to create a fresh, correct database**:
            ```bash
            npm run db:setup
            ```
            You should see messages confirming the schema was created and data was migrated.
        5.  **Restart the backend server**:
            ```bash
            pm2 restart aklasbella
            ```
        6.  Check the logs to confirm it started without errors: `pm2 logs aklasbella`.
        7.  Refresh the website. The games and login should now work.

-   **502 Bad Gateway Error**: This usually means Nginx can't connect to your backend.
    -   Check if the backend is running with `pm2 status`. If it has stopped or is in an errored state, check the logs with `pm2 logs aklasbella`.
-   **Permission Errors**: If you have issues with the database file, ensure its directory has the correct permissions: `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/backend`.
-   **Changes Not Appearing**: If you update frontend files, you may need to clear your browser cache. For backend changes, restart the process with `pm2 reload aklasbella`.
-   **Blank Page or "CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT MISCONFIGURATION" Error**:
    -   **Cause**: This is the other most common deployment error. It means your Nginx web server is serving the **development** folder (`/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv`) instead of the **production build** folder (`/var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/dist`). The browser is receiving a raw TypeScript file (`.tsx`) which it cannot execute.
    -   **Solution**: The error page itself contains the exact steps to fix this. You must edit your Nginx configuration and change the `root` directive to point to the correct `/dist` directory.
        1.  Open the configuration file on your server: `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/aklasbela-tv.com`
        2.  Find the line `root /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv;`
        3.  Change it to **`root /var/www/html/aklasbela-tv/dist;`**
        4.  Save the file, then restart Nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
        5.  Clear your browser's cache completely and reload your website. The error will be gone.
